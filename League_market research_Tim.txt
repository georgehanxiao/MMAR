Suggestions/improvments for nycoed
Hi Colin,
How are you? This is George from Metrotech08 and as you probably know we have been playing with NYCoed for almost 7 years. In my opinion NYCoed is one of the best-managed leagues in NYC, and that's why we keep coming back every season. 

Over the years, though, I've experienced difficulties managing teams as a captain. Some of these are merely  inconveniences but some are real challenges. Once some friends of mine realized lots of captains encountered the same issues, we started looking for a solution to address them. We have this idea of building a platform to connect all the recreational soccer players in NYC, and helping captains recruit right players and find suitable leagues. With gathered feedback from some players, I was wondering if you could kindly share with us some insights/advice from the perspective of a league organizer. It may only take 5 or 10 minutes of your time (perhaps a short call with questionnaires). I believe if we can put together the product, it will greatly enhance the users experience of a league like NYCoed, and benefit every registered player as well as teams in the long run.

Please let me know what you think and appreciate your assistance!

Regards,
George
